# Todo

## Bug Fixes
- Is it possible for the bottom-most FG row to have any gaps?
  - You'd probably need to weave the chain in a particular way
- Line tool behavior is buggy if you move your mouse out of the grid while it's held down


## Tools

### Must have
(none atm)

### Nice to have
- Print
  - Format pattern to be underneath grid
- Export grid as image file
- Export pattern text to file


## Settings

### Must have
- Toggle for row/stitch counters

### Nice to have
- Lefty flip
  - Reverse directions for all rows?
  - Also need to reverse stitch numbers (the ones on the top/bottom)
  - Some misc string stuff that needs updating too, like "thread the chain through the far-right hole"
  - Add a message to the top of the pattern as a reminder


## Other Features

### Must have
- Warning for IE and older browsers
  - CSS vars are IE-incompatible, so this def won't work there
- Test other major browsers (especially Mac Safari)
- Styling/functionality for smaller resolutions (ideally should be at least usable on mobile, even if it's a little shitty)
  - Test out all the tools
- Make border thicker every 10 squares
  - Maybe use outline so it doesn't make the squares any wider?
- "About" modal with contact email for bug reports etc.

### Nice to have
- Collapse toggle for sidebar
- Collapse toggle for grid
- Visual polish on buttons (indicator for being clicked, etc.)
- Make grid position:sticky on desktop
- Better cursor icon for line tool
