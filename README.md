# Todo

## Bug Fixes
- Change DrawingGridSquare contents to use SVGs instead of text, so they scale with square size

## Pattern Display!
- Every other row is flipped, both LTR vs. RTL *and* front vs. back stitches

## Tools

### Must have
- Save/Load
- Undo/Redo
  - Keep record of grid states, similar to the tic-tac-toe project
  - Create a new entry on mouse *up*

### Nice to have
- Print
  - Format pattern to be underneath grid
- Draw line


## Settings

### Must have
(none atm)

### Nice to have
- Flip for working in the round
  - Might just be not flipping anything for the WS?
- Lefty flip
  - Reverse directions for all rows?


## Other Features

### Must have
- Warning for IE and older browsers
  - CSS vars are IE-incompatible, so this def won't work there
- Warning when leaving the page
- Proper site title and favicon

### Nice to have
