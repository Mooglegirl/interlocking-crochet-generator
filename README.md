## Other Features

### Must have
- Warning for IE and older browsers
  - CSS vars are IE-incompatible, so this def won't work there

- Styling/functionality for smaller resolutions (ideally should be at least usable on mobile, even if it's a little shitty)
  - Test out all the tools
- Make border thicker every 10 squares
  - Maybe use outline so it doesn't make the squares any wider?
- "About" modal with contact email for bug reports etc.
