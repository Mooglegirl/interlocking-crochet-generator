### Nice to have
- Share as URL
  - Replace #'s in colors with something else, so they don't get read as hashes in the URL
  - When the param is detected (probably when App is first mounted), pass it to the load handler
    - Break loading out into a separate function that just takes the stringified object
    - Use u's decode function to convert param value back, then send it to said loading function
  - Add a copy button to modal
